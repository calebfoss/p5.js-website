Mind you, this is extremely interesting concepts on its own time, but I'd be skeptical of someone learning coding and p5 on their own to: 
a) have an Uno/ATMega board, 
b) have some knowledge of including and embedding libraries in p5 or even node, 
c) know the basics of Arduino entirely separately from learning p5, 
d) understand at least at a basic level how interoperability works between Arduino, p5, possibly node, etc,
e) be able to synthesize all of this with the example page at hand.

I think a overall lookover of this sketch specifically would be a good start, not necessarily because what I was going through couldn't be debugged by someone with the knowledge to do so, but moreso breaking the ""press this thing and it does that thing"" streak that the p5 examples seemingly strive to have.",No,5,No,No,,No,No,N/A,N/A or neither,0,0,0,0,No,No,Advanced,,1,
