arialabel: >-
  Continuous black flowers with a white circle center draw on a dark grey
  background as you move your mouse. The circles get bigger as you move your
  mouse faster and smaller as you move your mouse slower. When you stop your
  mouse, the last flower rotates slightly.

Software drawing instruments can follow a rhythm or abide by
rules independent of drawn gestures. This is a form of collaborative drawing
in which the draftsperson controls some aspects of the image and the software
controls others.
