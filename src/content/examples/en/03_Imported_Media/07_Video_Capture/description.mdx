Using the 
<a href="/reference/p5/createCapture/" target="_blank">createCapture()</a>
and <a href="/reference/p5/image/" target="_blank">image()</a> 
functions, you can take a device's video capture and draw it in the canvas. 
Since the video capture is passed through the
<a href="/reference/p5/image/" target="_blank">image()</a> 
constructor, you can add filters to the video capture with the 
<a href="/reference/p5/filter/" target="_blank">filter()</a> 
method. For different strategies for uploading, presenting, or styling videos, 
visit the
<a href="/examples/dom-video.html/" target="_blank">Video</a> and
<a href="/examples/dom-video-canvas.html/" target="_blank">Video Canvas</a> 
examples.
