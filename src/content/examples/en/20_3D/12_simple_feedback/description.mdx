title: Simple Feedback
arialabel: An example of a simple feedback effect using two buffers.

A simple feedback effect that is achieved by using two WebGL graphics buffers.
This effect works by drawing the previous frame to a second
createGraphics() buffer, which can be blended with the current frame. This
takes advantage of texture mapping in WebGL.
