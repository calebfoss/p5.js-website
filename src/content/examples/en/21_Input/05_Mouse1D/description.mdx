  Two fuschia squares on a grey background. As the user’s mouse moves to the
  left of the window, the fuschia square on the left increases to fill up the
  left half of the window as the right square disappears and vice versa as the
  user’s mouse moves right.

Move the mouse left and right to
shift the balance. The "mouseX" variable is used
to control both the size and color of the rectangles.
