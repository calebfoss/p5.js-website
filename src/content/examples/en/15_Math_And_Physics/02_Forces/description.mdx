Demonstration of multiple forces acting on bodies.
Bodies experience gravity continuously. Bodies experience fluid
resistance when in "water".
(<a href="http://natureofcode.com">natureofcode.com</a>)

The force calculations are performed using the
<a href="/reference/p5/p5.Vector/">p5.Vector</a>
class, including the
<a href="/reference/p5/createVector/">createVector()</a>
function to create vectors.
