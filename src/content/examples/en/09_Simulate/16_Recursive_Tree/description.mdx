title: Recursive Tree
arialabel: >-
  If the user’s mouse is on the far left side of the screen, there is a white
  vertical line on a black background. As the user’s mouse moves right, the top
  of the vertical line begins to expand into branches of a tree until it curves
  down into a very geometric tree

Renders a simple tree-like structure via recursion.
The branching angle is calculated as a function of the horizontal mouse
location. Move the mouse left and right to change the angle.
Based on Daniel Shiffman's <a href="https://processing.org/examples/tree.html">Recursive Tree Example</a> for Processing.
