Variables have a global or function "scope". For example,
variables declared within either the setup() or draw() functions may be
only used in these functions. Global variables, variables declared outside
of setup() and draw(), may be used anywhere within the program. If a function
variable is declared with the same name as a global variable, the program
will use the function variable to make its calculations within the current
scope.
