title: Arm
arialabel: >-
  Two ovals connected at the end to form an arm shape. One end is fixed at the
  center of the black background. The arm shape moves in a circular motion as
  the mouse moves around the screen

This example uses transform matrices to create
an arm. The angle of each segment is controlled with the
mouseX and mouseY position. The transformations applied to
the first segment are also applied to the second segment
because they are inside the same push() and
pop() matrix group.
