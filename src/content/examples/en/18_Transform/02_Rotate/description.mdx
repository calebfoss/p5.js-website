Rotating a square around the Z axis.
To get the results you expect, send the rotate function angle
parameters that are values between 0 and PI\*2 (TWO\_PI which is
roughly 6.28). If you prefer to think about angles as degrees
(0-360), you can use the radians() method to convert your values.
For example: rotate(radians(90)) is identical to the statement
rotate(PI/2). In this example, every even numbered second a jitter
is added to the rotation. During odd seconds, rotation moves CW and
CCW at the speed determined by the last jitter value.
