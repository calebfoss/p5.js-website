<p>An Envelope is a series of fades, defined
as time / value pairs. In this example, the envelope
will be used to "play" a note by controlling the output
amplitude of an oscillator.<br /><br />
The p5.Oscillator sends its output through
an internal Web Audio GainNode (p5.Oscillator.output).
By default, that node has a constant value of 0.5. It can
be reset with the osc.amp() method. Or, in this example, an
Envelope takes control of that node, turning the amplitude
up and down like a volume knob.</p>

sound file.</span></em></p>
