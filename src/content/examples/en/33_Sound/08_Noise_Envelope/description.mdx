arialabel: >-
  Lime green rectangle rises from the bottom of a black screen when the screen

<p>White Noise is a random audio signal with equal energy
at every part of the frequency spectrum</p>

<p>An Envelope is a series of fades, defined
as time / value pairs.</p>

<p>In this example, the p5.Env
will be used to "play" the p5.Noise like a drum by controlling its output
amplitude. A p5.Amplitude will get the level of all sound in the sketch, and
we'll use this value to draw a green rectangle that shows the envelope
in action.</p>
<p><em><span class="small"> To run this example locally, you will need the
<a href="http://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound">p5.sound library</a> and a
sound file.</span></em></p>
