  4 vertical stripes in grey, blue, green, and orange. They are displayed in a
  different order on the top half of the screen compared to the bottom half and
  this causes the colors to be perceived differently

Each color is perceived in relation to other colors. The top
and bottom bars each contain the same component colors, but a different
display order causes individual colors to appear differently.
