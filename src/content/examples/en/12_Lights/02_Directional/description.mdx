arialabel: >-
  Two spheres on both sides of a black screen that is lit by the mouse which
  acts as a light source. You can move this light source by moving your mouse to
  shine on different parts of the sphere and create different shadows

Move the mouse to change the direction of the light.
Directional light comes from one direction and is stronger when hitting a
surface squarely and weaker if it hits at a a gentle angle. After hitting a
surface, a directional light scatters in all directions.
