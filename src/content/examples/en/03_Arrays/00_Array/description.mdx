An array is a list of data. Each piece of data in an array
is identified by an index number representing its position in
the array. Arrays are zero based, which means that the first
element in the array is \[0], the second element is \[1], and so on.
In this example, an array named "coswave" is created and
filled with the cosine values. This data is displayed three
separate ways on the screen.
