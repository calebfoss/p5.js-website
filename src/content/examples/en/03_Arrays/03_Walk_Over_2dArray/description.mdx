contributed by [Prof WM Harris](https://www.rit.edu/directory/wmhics-w-michelle-harris), How to display 2D array contents on the canvas using regular for and for-of loops in multiple different ways.
A function is created for the canvas, the 2D array (Friend Array) is initialized and walked over using nested loops in different ways.
Variables x and y are used to place the array item on the canvas in the form of 2D array.
The final nested loop is used to initialize 2D array (Fish Array) with random Integers (fish ages).
