title: Linear Interpolation
arialabel: White circle follows the userâ€™s mouse around the screen

Move the mouse across the screen and the symbol will follow.
Between drawing each frame of the animation, the ellipse moves part
of the distance (0.05) from its current position toward the cursor using
the lerp() function.
This is the same as the Easing under input only with lerp() instead..
