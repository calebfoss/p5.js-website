  Red circle grows larger and turns more yellow as the user’s mouse moves right
  on the screen and does the opposite as the user’s mouse moves left

Use the map() function to take any number and scale it to a
new number that is more useful for the project that you are working on.
For example, use the numbers from the mouse position to control the size or color of a shape.
In this example, the mouse’s x-coordinate (numbers between 0 and 360) are scaled to new numbers
to define the color and size of a circle.
