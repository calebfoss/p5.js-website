If you don't explicitly state the order in which an
expression is evaluated, they are evaluated based on the operator
precedence. For example, in the statement "4+2*8", the 2 will
first be multiplied by 8 and then the result will be added to 4.
This is because the "*" has a higher precedence than the "+". To avoid
ambiguity in reading the program, it is recommended that is statement
is written as "4+(2\*8)". The order of evaluation can be controlled
through placement of parenthesis in the code. A table of operator
precedence follows below.
