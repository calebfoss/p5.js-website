  Grey circle with two grey circles across its middle. Each of these two grey
  circles have more grey circles across its middle. This pattern continues until
  no more can be drawn within them.

A demonstration of recursion, which means functions call themselves.
A recursive function must have a terminating condition, without which it will
go into an infinite loop. Notice how the drawCircle() function calls itself
at the end of its block. It continues to do this until the variable "level" is
equal to 1.
