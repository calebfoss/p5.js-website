title: orbitControl
module: 3D
submodule: Interaction
file: src/webgl/interaction.js
description: |
  <p>Allows movement around a 3D sketch using a mouse or trackpad or touch.
  Left-clicking and dragging or swipe motion will rotate the camera position
  about the center of the sketch, right-clicking and dragging or multi-swipe
  will pan the camera position without rotation, and using the mouse wheel
  (scrolling) or pinch in/out will move the camera further or closer
  from the center of the sketch. This function can be called with parameters
  dictating sensitivity to mouse/touch movement along the X and Y axes.
  Calling this function without parameters is equivalent to calling
  orbitControl(1,1). To reverse direction of movement in either axis,
  enter a negative number for sensitivity.</p>

example:

    <div>
    <code>
    function setup() {
      createCanvas(100, 100, WEBGL);
      normalMaterial();
      describe(
        'Camera orbits around a box when mouse is hold-clicked & then moved.'
      );
      camera(0, 0, 50*sqrt(3), 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0);
      perspective(PI/3, 1, 5*sqrt(3), 500*sqrt(3));
    }
    function draw() {
      background(200);

      // If you execute the line commented out instead of next line, the direction of rotation
      // will be the direction the mouse or touch pointer moves, not around the X or Y axis.
      orbitControl();
      // orbitControl(1, 1, 1, {freeRotation: true});

      rotateY(0.5);
      box(30, 50);
    }

      <p>An optional object that can contain additional settings,

      disableTouchActions - Boolean, default value is true.

      Setting this to true makes mobile interactions smoother by preventing

      accidental interactions with the page while orbiting. But if you're
      already

      doing it via css or want the default touch actions, consider setting it to
      false.

      freeRotation - Boolean, default value is false.

      By default, horizontal movement of the mouse or touch pointer rotates the
      camera

      around the y-axis, and vertical movement rotates the camera around the
      x-axis.

      But if setting this option to true, the camera always rotates in the
      direction

      the pointer is moving. For zoom and move, the behavior is the same
      regardless of

      true/false.</p>
