description: >
  <p>Creates a directional light with the given color and direction.</p>

  <p>Directional light comes from one direction.

  The direction is specified as numbers inclusively between -1 and 1.

  For example, setting the direction as (0, -1, 0) will cause the

  geometry to be lit from below (since the light will be facing

  directly upwards). Similarly, setting the direction as (1, 0, 0)

  will cause the geometry to be lit from the left (since the light

  will be facing directly rightwards).</p>

  <p>Directional lights do not have a specific point of origin, and

  therefore cannot be positioned closer or farther away from a geometry.</p>

  <p>A maximum of <strong>5</strong> directional lights can be active at
  once.</p>

  <p>Note: lights need to be called (whether directly or indirectly)

  within draw() to remain persistent in a looping program.

  Placing them in setup() will cause them to only have an effect

  the first time through the loop.</p>
