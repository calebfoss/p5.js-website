description: >
  <p>Sets a perspective projection for the current camera in a 3D sketch.

  This projection represents depth through foreshortening: objects

  that are close to the camera appear their actual size while those

  that are further away from the camera appear smaller.</p>

  <p>The parameters to this function define the viewing frustum

  (the truncated pyramid within which objects are seen by the camera) through

  vertical field of view, aspect ratio (usually width/height), and near and far

  clipping planes.</p>

  <p>If no parameters are given, the default values are used as:</p>

  <ul>

  <li><code>fov</code> : The default field of view for the camera is such that
  the full height of renderer is visible when it is positioned at a default
  distance of 800 units from the camera.</li>

  <li><code>aspect</code> : The default aspect ratio is the ratio of renderer's
  width to renderer's height.</li>

  <li><code>near</code> : The default value for the near clipping plane is 80,
  which is 0.1 times the default distance from the camera to its subject.</li>

  <li><code>far</code> : The default value for the far clipping plane is 8000,
  which is 10 times the default distance from the camera to its subject.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>If you prefer a fixed field of view, follow these steps:</p>

  <ol>

  <li>Choose your desired field of view angle (<code>fovy</code>). This is how
  wide the camera can see.</li>

  <li>To ensure that you can see the entire width across horizontally and height
  across vertically, place the camera a distance of <code>(height / 2) /
  tan(fovy / 2)</code> back from its subject.</li>

  <li>Call perspective with the chosen field of view, canvas aspect ratio, and
  near/far values:

  <code>perspective(fovy, width / height, cameraDistance / 10, cameraDistance *
  10);</code></li>

  </ol>
