  <p>This makes the canvas forget how far from the camera everything that has

  been drawn was. Use this if you want to make sure the next thing you draw

  will not draw behind anything that is already on the canvas.</p>

  <p>This is useful for things like feedback effects, where you want the
  previous

  frame to act like a background for the next frame, and not like a plane in

  3D space in the scene.</p>

  <p>This method is only available in WebGL mode. Since 2D mode does not have

  3D depth, anything you draw will always go on top of the previous content on

  the canvas anyway.</p>

  A red, green, and blue box (using normalMaterial) moves and rotates around
  the canvas, leaving a trail behind it that slowly grows and fades away.
example:
  - |-

    <div>
    <code>
    let prev, next;
    function setup() {
      createCanvas(100, 100, WEBGL);
      prev = createFramebuffer({ format: FLOAT });
      next = createFramebuffer({ format: FLOAT });
      noStroke();
    }

    function draw() {
      // Swap prev and next so that we can use the previous
      // frame as a texture when drawing the current frame
      [prev, next] = [next, prev];

      // Draw to the framebuffer
      next.begin();
      background(255);

      push();
      tint(255, 253);
      image(prev, -width/2, -height/2);
      // Make sure the image plane doesn't block you from seeing any part
      // of the scene
      clearDepth();
      pop();

      push();
      normalMaterial();
      translate(25*sin(frameCount * 0.014), 25*sin(frameCount * 0.02), 0);
      rotateX(frameCount * 0.01);
      rotateY(frameCount * 0.01);
      box(12);
      pop();
      next.end();

      image(next, -width/2, -height/2);
    }
    </code>
    </div>

      <p>The value, between 0 and 1, to reset the depth to, where

      0 corresponds to a value as close as possible to the camera before getting

      clipped, and 1 corresponds to a value as far away from the camera as
      possible.

      The default value is 1.</p>
