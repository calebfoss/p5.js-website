  <p>Get audio from an input, i.e. your computer's microphone.</p>


  <p>Turn the mic on/off with the start() and stop() methods. When the mic

  is on, its volume can be measured with getLevel or by connecting an

  FFT object.</p>


  <p>If you want to hear the AudioIn, use the .connect() method.

  AudioIn does not connect to p5.sound output by default to prevent

  feedback.</p>
