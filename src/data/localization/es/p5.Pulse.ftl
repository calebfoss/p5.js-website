description__0 = Creates a Pulse object, an oscillator that implements Pulse Width Modulation. The pulse is created with two oscillators. Accepts a parameter for frequency, and to set the width between the pulses. See <a href=" http://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Oscillator"> <code>p5.Oscillator</code> for a full list of methods.
params__freq = Number: (Optional) Frequency in oscillations per second (Hz)
params__w = Number: (Optional) Width between the pulses (0 to 1.0,  defaults to 0)
width__description__0 = Set the width of a Pulse object (an oscillator that implements Pulse Width Modulation).
width__params__width = Number: (Optional) Width between the pulses (0 to 1.0,  defaults to 0)
